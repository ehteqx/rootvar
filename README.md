# roolytics
CERN's ROOT (data analysis & simulation framework for particle and nuclear physics) for efficient (big) data analytics.

The software contained in this repository was produced during a springtime (2017) internship at INFN - Sezione di Trieste, organized by the University of Trieste as part of B.Sc. in Physics curriculum.  
Eventual software maintainance after 31/05/2017 UTC+1 should be considered as part of a hobby project, carried on in no official way whatsoever.

The software is licensed to the general public according to a custom BSD-ish license, inspired by that used by Los Alamos National Laboratories' open sourced projects.  
The license in its entirety is available in Markdown language within the LICENSE.md file contained in the same directory as this one.

COMPATIBILITY NOTICE: At the time of the writing (01/03/2017), the code in this repository has been developed - and is expected to work - with ROOT 6.09/01 (master@v6-09-01-1028-g5e8b2f4b45) as compiled on 13/01/2017 UTC+1. Backward compatibility with ROOT 5 is likely not available, while forward compatibility with ROOT 6 is not guaranteed but expected.
